# BrandonBeck.org
## About this Project
  This is the website for [BrandonBeck.org](https://brandonbeck.org), the memorial scholarship fund.

## Usage
  This package was created using `create-react-app`.

  To run a development server, type `npm install` then `npm start`.

## Design
  The site is static in nature and made with a lightweight, mobile-first design. The entire site is an SPA (using `react-router-dom`) and a small total bundle.
  
  This site was written using:
  * React through create-react-app (including customized webpack config)
  * Styling is using a customized version of Bulma (through Sass) and Font-Awesome's great, free svgs.
